rcl Found 36 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 3 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 10 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 37 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 23 times, found 4 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 125 times, found 6 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 145 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
