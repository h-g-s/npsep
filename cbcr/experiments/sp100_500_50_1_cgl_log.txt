rcl The largest admissible number was 4 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 5 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 52 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 0 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 60 times, found 5 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 36 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
