rcl Found 3 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 11 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 0 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 9 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 484 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 0 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 366 times
scl    all cliques have been enumerated
round 1 : cgl separated 3 cuts in 0.0100 seconds. dual limit now: 2598 time: 29.820
