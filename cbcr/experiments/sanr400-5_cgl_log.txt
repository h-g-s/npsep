solving relaxation ... Initial dual bound -41.6106
solved in 2.330

rcl Found 6 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 6 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 3 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 200 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 0 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 361 times, found 3 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 34 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
round 1 : cgl separated 8 cuts in 0.0600 seconds. dual limit now: -41.6106 time: 2.390
