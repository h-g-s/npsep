rcl Found 0 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 0 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 0 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 122 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 1 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 360 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 33 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
round 1 : cgl separated 0 cuts in 0.0400 seconds. dual limit now: -62.8767 time: 1.760
