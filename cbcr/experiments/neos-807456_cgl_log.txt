rcl Found 15 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 8 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 12 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 13 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 334 times, found 12 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 1 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 265 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
