rcl Found 13 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 3 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 20 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 14 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 66 times, found 20 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 13 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 57 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
round 1 : cgl separated 13 cuts in 0.0000 seconds. dual limit now: 917 time: 0.050
