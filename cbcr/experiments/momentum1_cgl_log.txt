solving relaxation ... Initial dual bound 72793.3
solved in 0.710

rcl Found 78 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 24 (threshold 12)
rcl    not all row cliques have been eliminated

scl Found 1 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 11 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 29 times, found 1 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 0 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 67 times
scl    all cliques have been enumerated
round 1 : cgl separated 3 cuts in 0.0100 seconds. dual limit now: 72793.3 time: 0.720
