rcl Found 139 new violated cliques with the row-clique method
rcl The largest admissible number was 11 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 10 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 29 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 0 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 18 times, found 10 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 37 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
