rcl The largest admissible number was 11 (threshold 12)
rcl    all row cliques have been enumerated

scl Found 19 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 15 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 91 times, found 18 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 4 times, found 1 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 81 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
