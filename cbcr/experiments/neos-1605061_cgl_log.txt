scl Found 7 new violated cliques with the star-clique method
scl The largest star size was 18 (threshold 12)
scl Enumeration 109 times, found 7 maxl cliques
scl Greedy 55 times, found 0 maxl cliques
scl Skipped a star b/c of small solution value 462 times
scl    not all cliques have been eliminated
