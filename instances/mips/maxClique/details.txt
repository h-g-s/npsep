Details of the random set packing instances.

Each file is a text file with a name of the form pknmt.lp
n represents the number of variables in hundreds
m represents the number of constraints in hundreds
t represents the type of problem:
	t=c for "cardinality" problems when all objective coefficients are 1.
	t=w for "weighted" problems where objective coefficients are random
	 integers uniformly distributed between 1 and 10.

In each case the coefficient of a variable in any constraint is 0 or 1 and is
generated randomly. The probability any constraint coefficient is 1 is 5%.
