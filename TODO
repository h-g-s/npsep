NPSep TODO list

Performance:
    o  remove dominated cliques from lp
    o  constraint propagation (using first variables which 
       are active in the relaxation ?)

Reorganization:
    o  osi_cgraph : make cgraph construction solver independent
        (a first step would be to separate functions which are not 
         solver dependent e.g. processClique into other .c files)
