Greedy Clique Partitioning: to provide a strenghtned rhs,  from the paper
     "Conflict Graphs in Integer Programming"

Multiple passes: after the CG is populated, another pass can increase the
     number of conflicts ? specially using greedy partitioning I think

Parallel construction of conflict graph: just splliting the constraint
     set in several processores should provide one speedup. we should
     check which procedures should be made thread safe
