  abstract = {The measure of the region dominated by (the maxima
                  of) a set of $n$ points in the positive $d$-orthant
                  has been proposed as an indicator of performance in
                  multiobjective optimization, known as the
                  hypervolume indicator, and the problem of computing
                  it efficiently is attracting increasing
                  attention. In this report, this problem is
                  formulated as a special case of Klee's measure
                  problem in $d$ dimensions, which immediately
                  establishes $O(n^{d/2}\log n)$ as a, possibly
                  conservative, upper bound on the required
                  computation time. Then, an $O(n log n)$ algorithm
                  for the 3-dimensional version of this special case
                  is constructed, based on an existing dimension-sweep
                  algorithm for the related maxima problem. Finally,
                  $O(n log n)$ is shown to remain a lower bound on the
                  time required by the hypervolume indicator for
                  $d>1$, which attests the optimality of the algorithm
                  proposed.},

                  can be seen as being composed of several algorithmic
                  components, each of which plays some specific role
                  with respect to overall performance. In this
                  article, we explore the application of experimental
                  design techniques to analyze the effect of different

                  also that the same choices for algorithmic
                  components can lead to different behavior in
                  dependence of various instance features, such as the

  abstract = { Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for
                  Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization Problems
                  (MCOPs) typically involve the selection and
                  parameterization of many algorithm components whose
                  role with respect to their overall performance and
                  relation to certain instance features is often not
                  clear. In this abstract, we use a modular approach
                  for the design of SLS algorithms for MCOPs defined
                  in terms of {P}areto optimality and we present an
                  extensive analysis of SLS algorithms through
                  experimental design techniques, where each algorithm
                  component is considered a factor. The experimental
                  analysis is based on a sound experimental
                  methodology for analyzing the output of algorithms
                  for MCOPs. We show that different choices for
                  algorithm components can lead to different behavior
                  in dependence of various instance features.},

                  overall performance. This article explores the

                  proposed for tackling multi-objective optimization
                  problems. In this paper, we propose a software
                  framework that allows to instantiate the most
                  prominent multi-objective ACO (MOACO)
                  algorithms. More importantly, the flexibility of
                  this MOACO framework allows the application of
                  automatic algorithm configuration techniques. The
                  experimental results presented in this paper show
                  that such an automatic configuration of MOACO
                  algorithms is highly desirable, given that our
                  automatically configured algorithms clearly
                  outperform the best performing MOACO algorithms that
                  have been proposed in the literature. As far as we
                  are aware, this paper is also the first to apply
                  automatic algorithm configuration techniques to
                  multi-objective stochastic local search algorithms.}

                  algorithms for tackling multiobjective combinatorial
                  optimization problems. These proposals adapt ACO
                  concepts in various ways, for example, some use
                  multiple pheromone matrices and multiple heuristic
                  matrices and others use multiple ant colonies.\\ In
                  this article, we carefully examine several of the
                  most prominent of these proposals. In particular, we
                  identify commonalities among the approaches by
                  recasting the original formulation of the algorithms
                  in different terms. For example, several proposals
                  described in terms of multiple colonies can be cast
                  equivalently using a single ant colony, where ants
                  use different weights for aggregating the pheromone
                  and/or the heuristic information. We study
                  algorithmic choices for the various proposals and we

                  distribution of the outcomes obtained by a

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the problem of maintaining
                  an approximation of the set of nondominated points
                  visited during a multiobjective optimization, a
                  problem commonly known as archiving. Most of the
                  currently available archiving algorithms are
                  reviewed, and what is known about their convergence
                  and approximation properties is summarized. The main
                  scenario considered is the restricted case where the
                  archive must be updated online as points are
                  generated one by one, and at most a fixed number of
                  points are to be stored in the archive at any one
                  time. In this scenario, the better-monotonicity of
                  an archiving algorithm is proposed as a weaker, but
                  more practical, property than negative efficiency
                  preservation. This paper shows that
                  hypervolume-based archivers and a recently proposed
                  multi-level grid archiver have this property. On the
                  other hand, the archiving methods used by SPEA2 and
                  NSGA-II do not, and they may better-deteriorate with
                  time. The better-monotonicity property has meaning
                  on any input sequence of points. We also classify
                  archivers according to limit properties,
                  i.e. convergence and approximation properties of the
                  archiver in the limit of infinite (input) samples
                  from a finite space with strictly positive
                  generation probabilities for all points. This paper
                  establishes a number of research questions, and
                  provides the initial framework and analysis for
                  answering them.},

                  (Hypervolume by Slicing Objectives) algorithm by
                  pruning the recursion tree to avoid repeated

                  experimental results show that the pruning

Multi-objective optimization problems are problems with several,
typically conflicting criteria for evaluating solutions. Without
any a priori preference information, the Pareto optimality
principle establishes a partial order among solutions, and the
output of the algorithm becomes a set of nondominated solutions
rather than a single one. Various ant colony optimization (ACO)
algorithms have been proposed in recent years for solving such
problems. These multi-objective ACO (MOACO) algorithms exhibit
different design choices for dealing with the particularities of
the multi-objective context. This paper proposes a formulation of
algorithmic components that suffices to describe most MOACO
algorithms proposed so far. This formulation also shows that
existing MOACO algorithms often share equivalent design choices
but they are described in different terms. Moreover, this
formulation is synthesized into a flexible algorithmic framework,
from which not only existing MOACO algorithms may be
instantiated, but also combinations of components that were never
studied in the literature. In this sense, this paper goes beyond
proposing a new MOACO algorithm, but it rather introduces a
family of MOACO algorithms. The flexibility of the proposed MOACO
framework facilitates the application of automatic algorithm
configuration techniques. The experimental results presented in
this paper show that the automatically configured MOACO framework
outperforms the MOACO algorithms that inspired the framework
itself. This paper is also among the first to apply automatic
algorithm configuration techniques to multi-objective algorithms.}

  abstract = {Reducing the energy consumption of water
                  distribution networks has never had more
                  significance. The greatest energy savings can be
                  obtained by carefully scheduling the operations of
                  pumps. Schedules can be defined either implicitly,
                  in terms of other elements of the network such as
                  tank levels, or explicitly by specifying the time
                  during which each pump is on/off.  The traditional
                  representation of explicit schedules is a string of
                  binary values with each bit representing pump on/off
                  status during a particular time interval.  In this
                  paper, we formally define and analyze two new
                  explicit representations based on time-controlled
                  triggers, where the maximum number of pump switches
                  is established beforehand and the schedule may
                  contain less switches than the maximum. In these
                  representations, a pump schedule is divided into a
                  series of integers with each integer representing
                  the number of hours for which a pump is
                  active/inactive.  This reduces the number of
                  potential schedules compared to the binary
                  representation, and allows the algorithm to operate
                  on the feasible region of the search space.  We
                  propose evolutionary operators for these two new
                  representations. The new representations and their
                  corresponding operations are compared with the two
                  most-used representations in pump scheduling,
                  namely, binary representation and level-controlled
                  triggers. A detailed statistical analysis of the
                  results indicates which parameters have the greatest
                  effect on the performance of evolutionary
                  algorithms. The empirical results show that an
                  evolutionary algorithm using the proposed
                  representations improves over the results obtained
                  by a recent state-of-the-art Hybrid Genetic
                  Algorithm for pump scheduling using level-controlled
                  triggers.}

                  minimization of the travel-cost. For solving this

                  differentiating between partial solutions. This work

                  extensive experimental evaluation on seven benchmark

                  a set of best compromise solutions for typically
                  conflicting objectives. Due to the complex nature of
                  most real-life problems, only an approximation to
                  such an optimal set can be obtained within
                  reasonable (computing) time. To compare such
                  approximations, and thereby the performance of
                  multi-objective optimizers providing them, unary
                  quality measures are usually applied. Among these,
                  the \emph{hypervolume indicator} (or
                  \emph{S-metric}) is of particular relevance due to
                  its favorable properties. Moreover, this indicator
                  has been successfully integrated into stochastic
                  optimizers, such as evolutionary algorithms, where
                  it serves as a guidance criterion for finding good
                  approximations to the Pareto front.\\ Recent results
                  show that computing the hypervolume indicator can be
                  seen as solving a specialized version of Klee's
                  Measure Problem.  In general, Klee's Measure Problem
                  can be solved with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n +
                  n^{d/2}\log n)$ comparisons for an input instance of
                  size $n$ in $d$ dimensions; as of this writing, it
                  is unknown whether a lower bound higher than
                  $\Omega(n \log n)$ can be proven.\\ In this article,
                  we derive a lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ for the
                  complexity of computing the hypervolume indicator in
                  any number of dimensions $d>1$ by reducing the

                  the three dimensional case, we also present a

  abstract = { The longest common subsequence problem is a
                  classical string problem that concerns finding the
                  common part of a set of strings. It has several
                  important applications, for example, pattern
                  recognition or computational biology. Most research
                  efforts up to now have focused on solving this
                  problem optimally. In comparison, only few works
                  exist dealing with heuristic approaches. In this
                  work we present a deterministic beam search
                  algorithm. The results show that our algorithm
                  outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches
                  not only in solution quality but often also in
                  computation time.}
